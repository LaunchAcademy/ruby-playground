#Taking Care of the Space and Each Other

##Mission Control Guidelines
Thank you for helping us to keep Mission Control a clean, welcoming environment for our instructors, students, hiring partners, guest speakers and other visitors. This is your home for the next ten weeks, and you have a lot of roommates. The guidelines set here are to ensure that anyone who may enter our space gets the impression that our students are highly intelligent, hard-workers, who know how to be both professional and personable. Should we get a surprise visit from a prospective hiring partner, a clean, clutter-free space will help our case for employers to want to hire a Launcher – we have the most capable students and they know how to be great employees!

**DO NOT:**  
- Bring a bike upstairs using the passenger elevator  
- Go up to the roof  
- Prop open any doors (especially not external building doors)  
- Smoke near building access points  
- Eat or have open containers at the work stations  
- Leave funky food in the fridge or spills on the counters  
- Forget to return your key and FOB at the end of the cohort!

###Need-to-Know Information
####Building
**Building Hours:**  
Monday-Friday: 	7:00am - 10:00 pm  
Weekends:	8:00am -  5:00pm	(FOBs required for access)

- **Restrooms:** There are keys hung up on the wall by the front door (5 for 5th Floor, 6 for 6th Floor). Occasionally the restroom doors are locked so you may use these to unlock them. Just as you would our suite space, please keep these tidy as we want to be sure any prospective hiring partners have clean bathrooms to visit as well.
If doors are locked, unlock them and keep them unlocked- we play a little game with our neighbors and like to win here :)
To access the 6th Floor bathroom, you must use the elevator
- **Stairwell:** Most days of the week the stairwell is locked, so you are able to walk down from the 5th Floor to get outside, but can not always take the stairs up. Do not prop open any external building doors (back staircase or front entrance)
- **Roof:** Students are NOT allowed on the roof of the building. If you are found on the roof, you will be removed from the program- zero tolerance
- **Smoking:** Tenants are asked to not smoke near the entrance to the building and are suggested to stand closer to the corner of Harrison and Beach Street.
- **Bicycles:** Bikes are suggested to be brought up in the freight elevator. Call/text Building Manager Austin in advance of your arrival and he will assist you - 617.875.8172. If Austin is unavailable, try Switchboard at 617.426.1515. If no one is available when you arrive, feel free to use the passenger elevator, but please be cautious of other tenants and the walls! You may also ring the bell in the passenger elevator to alert Austin of your arrival if you’d still like his assistance getting your bike upstairs.

####Cleaning Up the Workstations and Kitchenette
- **Work areas:** No food or open liquid containers at the work desks! Keep desks clean and check for trash on, around or near your area before you leave at the end of the day. Anything left out in the space will make it very difficult for the cleaning crew to do their job!
- **“Leave-behinds”:** Anything left around the space (on chairs, tables, couches, etc.) and on the dish rack will be placed in a “leave-behind” bin, located on the bottom right shelf of the storage rack. Items should be removed from this bin by Friday afternoon as anything left in it come Monday morning will be tossed/donated. Utilize your lockers! The “leave-behind” bin can be found on the bottom shelf of the gray storage rack.
- **Refrigerator:** Our space is funky, our fridge is not! Please mark items with your name and date. The fridge is cleared out every Friday via a rotating student schedule, and anything that is unmarked (or without a current date) or sprouting will be tossed. If it is your turn to clean out the fridge: (1) Take out all unmarked items and put them on the counter (2) Send out a message to the cohort to come identify or throw away their items before a certain time (3) Clean up any spills in the fridge (4) Throw away whatever is left out on the counter. All students will be on cleanout duty once.
- **Toaster ovens/microwaves:** Please wipe down after use so they are clean for the next person.
- **Coffee maker:** We are a green organization so please bring a reusable cup/mug to Mission Control. We do have paper cups, but reserve those primarily for visitors’ use.  Please don’t remove your cup from the machine until after the light shuts off to prevent spillage
- **Counters and table:** Please wipe up any spills and throw away all trash.  If you do not know how to wipe up spills, let a Launch staff member know and they will model it for you.
- **Sink and dish rack:** Do not leave dishes in the sink. Utilize the dish rack and then move your items to the lockers.  Items left in the sink will be used as communal sponge holders.

####General Mission Control Items
- **Internet:**
WiFi Networks: Launch Academy
Password: MakeNoBugs!
- **White boards:** If you do not want your work erased, please mark it clearly; otherwise the cleaning crew will erase it each evening.
- **HVAC/Heat:** No one other than staff is allowed to touch the thermostat or heat valves. Bring layers!
- **Courtesy in the work areas:** Use headphones if you want to listen to music during individual exercises - no noisy video or music in the work area. Silence your phones (keep them on vibrate), and take calls away from the work area. No loud voices. No strong fragrances.
- **Greeting visitors:** If you are nearest to a visitor when they enter Mission Control, please welcome them, ask for their name (and introduce yourself), and walk them to the appropriate staff member’s office. Should he/she not be at her desk, have them take a seat on the couches and alert the Operations Manager. Act as if Launch Academy is your company and a guest has just arrived.

[Back to top](#)

####Keys and FOBs
Everyone will receive a key to the suite and a FOB to access the elevator off-hours. Building hours are posted by the side door so take note of these and lock up if you are the last to leave the suite at night. **Keys and FOBs are due back to the Operations Manager’s desk the Friday after Career Day by noon!**

If the doors are locked in the front of the building or the gate is not up at these times, contact Whitney via Slack 1-to-1.

You may leave the space after these hours but must do so via the back staircase located at the end of the hallway past the bathrooms.  The back staircase leads to the street on the side of the building.  The doors to and from the back staircase should never be propped open. This is a major security breach and can result in removal from the program.

#Endorsement

While everyone entering Launch Academy is talented and has the potential to be a great developer, there’s no guarantee that everyone is going to keep up with the intense pace. While everybody gets to graduate from Launch, endorsement is only available to students who are able to perform up to Launch Academy standards. Sometimes a student is not on track to be successful at Career Day, at which point Launch will choose not to endorse that student. This means that the student will not be presented to hiring partners on Career Day.

Whether or not a student is on track will be measured by looking at three different areas of their performance:

- **Systems Checks:** Systems Checks are challenges assigned every Friday that review the week’s material. They must be completed alone, and serve as a demonstration of how well you understand the material from the past week. If you fail two systems checks, you will lose your endorsement.

- **Mock Interviews:** There will be two rounds of mock technical interviews during the cohort, starting around Week 6. These serve as a chance to practice for your job search, and also a chance for the staff to make sure you’re up to speed on basic technical concepts. If you fail both mock interviews, you will lose your endorsement.

- **Launcher Profile and Resume Preparation:** Starting around Week 6, Whitney and Corinne will work with you to prepare your resume and Launcher Profile (both of which Hiring Partners will view during career day). If you fail to complete these, or fall far below their expectations, you won’t be considered ready for career day. If you are marked as failing to meet expectations for both of these, you will lose your endorsement.

Each systems check, mock interview, profile and resume will be graded as either **meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet expectations.**  

If you fail one item, you and your mentor should have a discussion on how to get you back on track.

**If you fail two items within one category, you will lose your endorsement** and your privileges to attend Career Day. It is possible to re-earn your endorsement through extra hard work. You, your mentor, and DT will have a discussion on what steps can be taken and whether or not it is possible to re-earn your endorsement and Career Day attendance.

There is page on Horizon where you can easily see whether you've any items, so you can keep easy track of where you stand in the cohort.

#Career Services
One of the many fantastic parts of Launch Academy are the Career Services you’ll have access to during and after your time here. Corinne is amazing at what she does, and she’s here for you as your own personal job-search-support-crew! That said, don’t spend the early weeks here worrying about job search prep. Your main job at the beginning is to work on becoming an awesome developer, and be ready to be on the ball as soon as Corinne needs things from you later down the line!

##Requirements

##Staff Availability

Staff at Launch Academy have a lot of varied responsibilities, so it's important that we all organize our time carefully.

When EEs are "off the floor" - i.e., in the EE lounge or the pairing office in the back of the room, they aren't available to answer technical questions. Both spaces are off-limits to students.

For day-to-day technical questions, ask one of the two EEs who are on the floor every afternoon. You can also visit office hours by signing up on the sheet of paper on the back picnic tables.

In reference to broader concerns than day-to-day technical questions, you should definitely feel comfortable getting in touch with your mentor - slack is usually a great place to find them! They are here to support you.

##Important Dates

**Mon, 9/7:** Labor Day - MC is closed, no daily schedule  
**Mon, 7/3:** Columbus Day - MC is closed, no daily schedule  
**Tues, 7/28 - Weds, 7/29:** Career Days

##Launcher Lunches
Launcher Lunches are a weekly chance for the staff to receive feedback directly from the students. Each Wednesday at noon, two EEs and a small group of students will go out to lunch together and discuss how the program is going. Invites will be distributed via slack so you know which week you are attending!

##Absences

It is very crucial to take full advantage of the time you have at Launch Academy and try to be present every single day. That said, if you are sick and can't be productive at Mission Control, get in touch with your mentor and the two of you can work together to make sure you stay caught up.

While we don't recommend it, if you have a pre-existing obligation that you want to see if you can make work, talk to your mentor and they can help give you and idea about whether it's feasible or not with extra work.

[Back to top](#)

##Office Hours

Office Hours serve as a chance to sit down with an EE and take some time to work through a problem together. You can sign up for office hours by writing your name in a slot on the relevant sheet of paper on the back picnic tables. Some great uses of office hours include:

- Getting a code review on a project you've written
- Working together to refactor some code you're working on
- Getting extra help with a topic you feel weaker on
- Diving deeper into a more advanced topic you're excited about
- Bouncing ideas for a side project around
- Pair-programming on a tricky piece of code

You should make sure to sign up for office hours around once every two weeks.

[Back to top](#)

##Breakable Toys
Your Breakable Toy is a project you will build over the course of your time here, and that is meant to showcase what you've learned at the end of the cohort. More details will be forthcoming about the ideal scope and focus of the project. Ideally, you'll be able to pick a great topic/goal/purpose, and make it something you're really passionate about! While the last two weeks of the cohort are purely dedicated to Breakable Toy work, it always helps to start earlier, so start brainstorming early what sort of project you might be excited to build.

#Launch Tools

There are a number of different tools and resources you’ll have at your disposal during your time at Launch! Here is a walkthrough of the things you should be aware of and paying attention to.

##Calendar
You should have access to a Google Calendar called “Mission Control”. This will the home-base for information on lesson schedules, clinics, office hours, Launch events, tech community events. Visit here often to make sure you’re up-to-date with what’s going on!

[Back to top](#)

##Slack and the Staff Announcements Channel
On Slack, there is a channel called Staff Announcements. This is for only staff to post in (so don’t write anything there yourself!), and is where we will announce important day-to-day information such as the release of new challenges. Make sure that you pay attention to everything posted in that channel - you will get behind if you tune out!

[Back to top](#)

##Horizon
Horizon will in many ways be your home base for information at Launch. Luckily, you should already have some familiarity with Horizon from your Ignition challenge submissions!

###Horizon Dashboard
Your [Horizon Dashboard](https://horizon.launchacademy.com/dashboard) serves as a home base for all the most important information you'll need on a day-to-day basis. This includes:
- A list of upcoming **calendar events**, spanning the next two days
- The **latest announcements** from the Staff Announcements channel
- A list of all **core, required assignments** and whether or not they've been completed and reviewed
- A list of all **optional, non-core assignments**
- A feed of all **most recent relevant activity** you should be aware of.

###Questions Queue

The [questions queue](https://horizon.launchacademy.com/questions) will serve as your primary way of getting assistance from staff members. When stuck on a problem, make sure to search Horizon (via the topbar) to see if anyone else has asked a relevant question.

After reading the **[guide on solving problems and asking questions](asking-questions-at-launch)**, if you still can't solve your problem after about 20 minutes of being stuck, add a question on Horizon. An EE will either provide a possible answer, comment requesting more info, or add your question to the **Question Queue**.

The Question Queue is a list of questions in line to get in-person help from an EE. When it's your turn, you and an EE will work together to solve the problem. Once solved, write out the answer on your Horizon question so that others can benefit in the future!

After a question has been successfully answered, don't forget to click "accept answer" to show the answer fixed your problem.

###Lesson Plan

Besides using the calendar to stay up-to-date on daily events, you can keep track of reading, assignments, and clinic notes by checking out the [Daily Lesson Plan](https://horizon.launchacademy.com/lessons/daily-lesson-plan) on Horizon.

##Suggestion Ox
[Suggestion Ox](http://www.suggestionox.com/response/zLQXp6) is our internal tool by which to receive anonymous feedback. We take a look at Suggestion Ox feedback once a week and discuss any suggestions as a team. Please be sure not to submit questions through Suggestion Ox that you need immediate feedback for or an individual response for.
