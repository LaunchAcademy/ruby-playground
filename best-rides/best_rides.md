You and your best friend almost always agree on what the best rides are.
Write a program to check what your friend's favorite ride was, and then
agree with it no matter what! There should be three steps:

1. Use "puts" to print a string asking your friend what his/her favorite ride was.
2. Use "gets" to accept user input via the terminal window.
3. Print a string exclaiming that was your favorite ride too (no need to
   specifically reference the ride, though).

Example Output:

```
Hey Carrie! What was your favorite ride?
=> the roller coaster!
OH WOW me too!!! I loved that one!
```
