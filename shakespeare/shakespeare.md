# Shakespeare

Write a method that reads in a text file and outputs a hash containing the
frequency that each word occurs within the text.

## Sample Input

In `words.txt`:

```no-highlight
hello hello world
```

```ruby
word_frequency('words.txt')
```

## Sample Output

```ruby
{
  "hello" => 2,
  "world" => 1
}
```
