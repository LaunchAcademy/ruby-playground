##Cultural Agreement

This is a promise to myself and those who will join me in this upcoming journey concerning my cultural experience at Launch Academy. If I successfully follow the code of conduct contained here within, I will contribute to a healthy and functional learning environment. The bottom line is I want to thrive and I want those around me to thrive during my time here. My time at Launch Academy is an opportunity to develop habits that will serve me well following graduation, both professionally and personally.

###Learning Environment Commitments
- I will face my fears by experimenting with new technologies and sharing (very often) my weaknesses, needs, and opportunities for growth with those around me.
- I will not waste these ten short weeks. I am 100% invested in my experience.  I will put my other obligations on hold so that I may give my experience its due attention.
- I will trust the proven formula at Launch Academy as I know its worked for many others before me.

###Collaboration and Support
- I will be sensitive to what others don’t know and show respect for their learning process.
- I will be vulnerable to the learning experience by sharing what I do and do not know, without pride.
- I will congratulate my classmates on their strengths as often as possible.
- I will provide feedback early and often to the Launch Academy team.
- I will be inclusive and collaborative with my work and my peers.

###Assholes, Bullies and Jerks
- I will not harm the experience of others or ruin my own reputation, because I will avoid the following:
  * Distasteful jokes, bigotry and hate
  * Parading skills and knowledge
  * Spreading negativity and trash talk
  * Combative messages sent via any medium to anyone

###Citizenship and Domestic Considerations
- If I bring a guest to Launch Academy, they must come to my morning stand up and provide their ID to the Operations Manager.
- I will be considerate of my footprint, knowing that nobody is here to clean up after me.  This is my house as much as it is anyone elses.  I’ll treat it as such, with pride.
- I will greet visitors if I am nearby. If I am able I will spend a couple of minutes assisting them.
- I will lock the door if I am the last to leave Mission Control at night or on the weekends.
- I will never go to the roof of the building or into the staff offices, and I understand I will be expelled from the program if I do so.

###Professionalism and Compliance during the Job Hunt
Launch Academy wants to help me get a job, and the following commitments will make it possible.

I will:  
- Stay in touch with Launch Academy regularly
- Take ownership of my job search
- Seek and follow advice from the staff
- Polish my resume and LinkedIn profile
- Send well-crafted emails.  If I need advice on an email or whether to send it, I will ask someone at Launch to assist me before sending it.
- Keep the Director of Talent informed of all interview activity
- Stay in Boston 3 weeks or more immediately following Career Day (if seeking a job in Boston).

I will not:
- Share information about or negotiate my salary without first discussing it with the Director of Talent
- Engage with a hiring partner without the Director of Talent’s knowledge
- Drink more than 1 alcoholic beverage when a hiring partner is present
- Ridicule members of the tech community or any organization that could affect my reputation or the reputation of my fellow Launchers.
