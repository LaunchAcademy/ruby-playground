# Multiply Lists

## Instructions

Implement a ruby program that takes in 2 lists of positive integers and
multiplies corresponding elements in each list.

Your program should accept a single string containing two lists of
positive integers. Lists are separated by a pipe `|` character and
integers are separated by spaces.

Valid inputs:

```ruby
19 6 2 | 0 24 9
2 | 9
```

Invalid inputs:

```ruby
1 3 17 | 44
```

Your program should return a single string with the result of
multiplying corresponding integers.

Valid Input / Output Examples:

```ruby
2 5 | 1 10 => 2 50

1 4 8 | 3 7 => "Lists must be same length"
```

To complete this drill get all three test cases to pass by replacing
"SOLUTION GOES HERE" in `lib/multiply_lists.rb` with your solution.
