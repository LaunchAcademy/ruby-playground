## How the Course Works

### Challenge Based Learning

Each phase consists of a series of units. Each unit requires you to consume
learning material, complete a small exercise, and then complete a larger
challenge. The learning material will introduce a new concept and the small
exercise will require you to start working with that new concept. The following
challenge is larger in scope and will often require you to combine this newly
acquired skill with concepts that you've previously learned.

### Phases of Learning

Each phase covers a major topic in software and web development. The program is
divided into *core* curriculum (phases 1 - 12) and *supplemental* curriculum.
The learning continues as you work through the supplemental curriculum. A breakdown of
these phases is provided alter in this article.


### System Checks and Advancing Phases

Each phase requires the completion of a **System Check**. The System Check is a
way for us to evaluate whether you have successfully achieved the desired learning
outcomes in the phase. When you have completed a phase and are prepared for the
phase's System Check, simply visit the [Horizon](https://learn.launchacademy.com/)
dashboard, click the `Take System Check` button, and follow the directions from there.
System Checks are challenges that are small in scope, and are intended to be completed within a 3 hour period.

System Checks are the only projects that must be completed individually.
Please do not share your resulting code with others or post your work online.

Like working professionally as a software developer, you can use all
of the resources at your disposal. Our curriculum, Google, and all online
documentation can be referenced for you to complete the System Check.
The Launch Academy staff can help to clarify questions about the assignment, but
they will limit their answers in order to not provide technical clues.

System Checks are reviewed by a staff member and are evaluated as to whether your
code exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet expectations. If
you do not meet expectations, you'll be given some directions and an opportunity
to revise your submission. Based on your System Check performance, your mentor may
require additional work and review before they advance you to the next phase.
Once you've met expectations, you will advance to the next phase of learning.

### Live Q & A's

Live Q & A's are held on a **weekly** basis. They are hosted via live video chat by a member of
our experience engineering team. These sessions provide a great opportunity for you to ask questions
and gain a greater understanding of the concepts that are part of our curriculum.
All students, regardless of where they are in the program are welcome, so some
questions asked in these sessions may not be immediately pertinent to you.
If you cannot attend a workshop, or if the questions asked aren't relevant to
you at the time, don't worry! It will be recorded for your benefit, and you will
be able to review and reference the video at a time that is convenient for you.

### Weekly 1-on-1's

1-on-1's are dedicated, scheduled times where you mentor can help you to
reach your goals. They are an hour long and occur weekly.
You will scheduled your 1-on-1's with your mentor on a monthly basis.

The weekly 1-on-1 is intended for you to set the agenda. Your mentor is dedicated
to serving you during that time. Topics can include code review, questions about what you're currently learning,
questions about a tangential technology you've been playing with, or how to prepare for your job search.
You should be prepared to make the most of the time.

**Tips for a successful 1-on-1**

* Ensure you've got a strong Internet connection. We've had bad luck with coffee
  shops and mobile connections, so it's best to be on a dedicated home or
  business connection.
* Ensure you have headphones, a microphone, and a webcam. Sometimes, the
  microphone that
  comes with your computer picks up too much background noise, so ensure you
  have a directional microphone or that you're in a quiet place. If you're
  unsure about your A/V setup, please consult a staff member.
* Alert your mentor ahead of time about what you wish to cover. Ideally, provide
  24 hours notice in advance via a slack direct message.
  You can choose to alter the agenda with your mentor at the beginning of the call
  if things change for you.
* Share where you've been challenged as you work through the curriculum. Discuss
  concepts that require further clarification.
* Check in on your goals for the working through the program. Your mentor can
  help to adjust your approach and your experience to better meet your goals.
* Make progress! There won't be much to talk about if you haven't advanced
  in the course since the last 1-on-1.

**Cancelling 1-on-1's**

If something comes up, you may cancel your 1-on-1 for that week. Let your mentor know via Slack that you won't be able to attend your regularly scheduled 1-on-1. We will do our best to reschedule you, however, availability is dependent on your mentor's schedule.

## Phase Overview

The *core* curriculum is divided into 12 phases. In order to acquire career
services, you must complete phases 1 - 9. After the core phases are
completed, you can continue to learn with us through our supplemental phases.
