# Regular Expressions Drill

It's time to put your Regular Expressions to practice. In this kata you will:

* Validate email
* Validate a phone number
* Validate a password
* Validate a username
* Validate a credit card number
* Validate that a string contains only digits
* Validate that a string contains only letters
* Validate a social security number
* Validate a US zip code

You will get the most out of this if you don't go looking on StackOverflow for the answers. Try using [Rubular](www.rubular.com) to test out regular expressions. Put your validations in validations.rb and run the tests to get started `ruby test/validations_test.rb`.
