### Instructions

Write a program to check if words and sentences are [Palindromes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled the same forwards and backwards. Initialize your `Palindrome` class with a string. When we call the `is_palindrome?` method, it should return either true or false.

The **palindrome_spec.rb** file contains several examples that should pass once the `is_palindrome?` method is complete. Running `rspec palindrome_spec.rb` will run the test suite for this class. You should add more test examples to this file to ensure that your Palindrome class works the way you expect.
