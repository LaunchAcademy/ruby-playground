#Write a palindrome checker

Write a method `def palindrome?(string)` in `code.rb` that takes a string as an argument and returns `true` or `false` based on the input.

A *palindrome* is a string that is the same forwards as backwards. The following are examples of *palindromes* (which would return `true` if ran through the `palindrome?` method):

```
A Santa at NASA
racecar
eye
Acrobats stab orca
anna
```

* Assume that punctuation and numbers will not be part of the string. Ignore capitalization (i.e., `A` should be treated like `a`) and spaces.
* Do the assignment with TDD if you want some TDD practice (you likely will need another file in addition to `code.rb` for your test suite if you choose to do this)!
