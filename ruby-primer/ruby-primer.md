Start with the Ruby Monk ["Ruby Primer"](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) and complete the following sections:

* Introduction to Ruby Objects
* Introduction to Strings
* Conditions and Loops: Control Structures in Ruby
* Arrays in Ruby
* Hashes in Ruby

Remember to work through "Ruby Primer" in order, from the top down, so you can maximize your learning experience.  Don't be afraid to go back and look at concepts again if you're getting a little confused.  And take a break if you get stuck - you'll be surprised how a short walk can help get yourself unstuck!

#### Tips:

* Click the `RUN` button before attempting a problem. This will give you all the errors, which you can use to guide you to the solution.
* It is highly recommended to finish as many of the problems at the bottom of the page as possible. You may skip the ones unrelated to the topics listed above.
