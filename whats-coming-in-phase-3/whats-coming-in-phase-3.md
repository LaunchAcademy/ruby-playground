### Phase 3 begins: 1/20/15

In Phase 3, we are going to cover some of the core concepts of what we do as programmers:

*  Arrays
*  Hashes
*  Iteration
*  Compound Data Structures
*  Git & Github

If you have completed all of Phase 2 before January 19th we recommend doing some
problems on [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/).  Focus on the
easy problems first and then work through the harder ones. Drop your new
discoveries into the Spring 2015 Flow!

It would also be a great idea to start reading and familiarizing yourself with
the documentation for these core concepts:

*  [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html)
*  [Hashes](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Hash.html)
*  [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html)
